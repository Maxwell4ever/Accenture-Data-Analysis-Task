## Background (Here are some key facts about this program:)

My team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz.

***The Business:*** Refers to the client and my internal team members who won’t be involved in detailed data analysis.
They rely on my analysis to make strategic business decisions.
Importantly, not everyone had a strong understanding of data. My job is to communicate my data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.
 
***The Data*** Refers to the relevant data sources that I cleaned, processed, and used to generate interesting insights for the business.

# Accenture-Data-Analysis-Task 2
#### Identify which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question

#### Clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis

#### Determine the answer to the client’s business question

### The client has sent through:

***7 data sets*** - each data set contains different columns and values
***A data model*** - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions I’ll follow these steps:

#### 1. Requirements gathering
Data cleaning

Data modelling
